[Windows PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell) is a mighty script system and now it can be used for building, deploying and everything else in [Atlassian Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo). You can easily create, edit and run scripts directly in Bamboo enjoying syntax highlighting and configuring your scripts with arguments and environment variables. Also scripts benefit from [Bamboo variables](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-variables-289277087.html) substitutions.

##### Features

* Show script exit code
* Control whether to load user profile
* Choose PowerShell bitness
* Linux support (pwsh and pwsh-preview)
